# functional-encryption 
The project focuses on a specialized encryption method for color images, particularly targeting the R (Red) channel. Traditional encryption methods often encrypt the entire image, leading to higher computational costs. This project leverages a functional-based encryption model tailored for the red channel to reduce complexity and improve performance while maintaining security.
