# 🔐 Functional-Based Encryption System for Red Channel of Color Image

This project implements a *functional-based encryption system* for the *Red channel* of a color image. The goal is to selectively encrypt only the red channel while leaving the green and blue channels untouched, thereby preserving partial visual data and enabling efficient, targeted encryption.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔻 1. *Channel Extraction*
•⁠  ⁠A color image (RGB) is read.
•⁠  ⁠It is split into its individual *Red, **Green, and **Blue* channels.

### 🔒 2. *Red Channel Encryption*
Encryption is applied *only* to the Red channel using a two-step process:
1.⁠ ⁠*XOR Encryption using KM Generator (a custom PRNG):*
   - A pseudo-random stream is generated using modular arithmetic.
   - The red channel is XORed with this stream for the first layer of encryption.
2.⁠ ⁠*Blum Blum Shub (BBS) Functional Encryption:*
   - A cryptographically secure PRNG (BBS) generates a second pseudo-random sequence.
   - This sequence is added modulo 256 to the XOR-encrypted red channel.

The final output is a partially encrypted image with:
•⁠  ⁠*Encrypted Red channel*
•⁠  ⁠*Unencrypted Green and Blue channels*

### 🔐 3. *Red Channel Decryption*
Decryption follows the reverse of encryption:
•⁠  ⁠First, subtract the BBS sequence modulo 256.
•⁠  ⁠Then, apply XOR decryption using the same PRNG stream to recover the original red channel.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 🔢 PRNG (KM Generator)
⁠ matlab
Xn = mod(Xn * M * I, m);
 ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Uses seed, multiplier ⁠ M ⁠, irrational constant ⁠ I ⁠, and modulus ⁠ m ⁠ for randomness.

### ⚙️ XOR Encryption
⁠ matlab
EncryptedData = bitxor(uint8(originalData), uint8(randStream));
 ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Lightweight operation for initial confusion of the red channel.

### 🧬 Blum Blum Shub Functional Encryption
⁠ matlab
x = mod(x^2, n); % Secure random stream
 ⁠
•⁠  ⁠A secure stream is added to further obfuscate the XORed data.

## 🖼️ Output Images
•⁠  ⁠*XOR Encrypted Red Channel*
•⁠  ⁠*BBS Encrypted Red Channel*
•⁠  ⁠*Final Encrypted Image*
•⁠  ⁠*Decrypted (partially and fully) Red Channels*

Histograms for original vs encrypted red channels are also displayed to visualize pixel value diffusion.
